## About

I created this utility with two purposes in mind: as an **educator**, to enhance my tuition material, and as a **student** to better visualise my own exercises.

The UI ecosystem already has very good fretboard libraries, but my use case was different and none of them could fulfill all my needs, so in order to keep my skills fit I wrote it from scratch.

As I was moving from rhythm / mainly chord based playing to exploring lead guitar, the dev process helped me in getting a deeper understanding of the fretboard structure.

<!--examples.boxes.1-->
This example shows two adjacent **E minor pentatonic** boxes.

<!--examples.boxes.2-->
This example shows the connection between the **C-shaped box** and the **A-shaped box** of the D major scale.

<!--examples.boxes.3-->
The G major scale in all five CAGED boxes. See how they share fret positions vertically!

<!--examples.boxes.4-->
Same as above, but with the G major pentatonic.

<!--examples.tetrachords-->
An [heptatonic scale][1] is made up of two adjacent [tetrachords][2], a whole tone apart that is.

<!--examples.playback-->
This example highlights the **diatonic seventh arpeggios** in the C major scale played in eight position.

Every arpeggio spells the **seventh chord** built by stacking thirds on top of every degree of the major scale, according to the scale structure (e.g. **C-E-G-B**, **D-F-A-C**, ...).
